            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I saw this book on Twitter, and decided to purchase the e-book (the paperback was €30 in shipping fees. Jesus Christ, no). It's about 40 pages, and a great read.</p>
                <p>It's a collection of three stories that are connected to eachother, about various topics. The one that stuck with me the most is the first one, about baseball. The author describes their deep and intimate relationship with baseball, and the Yankees "I actually used my heart to shoot beams of lovetowards each individual member of the Yankees when they were hitting the ball.".</p>
                <p>The book has a kind of Tumblr-vampire craze era vibe to it, and there are also lots of mentions of sexual abuse, which are things I can relate to a lot.</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed reading this book. It has the exact same vibes as Dog of Dracula, or Class of '09. There's this sort of homesick nostalgia and melancholy that is crammed into every single word. I'm not sure what to call them? But they are experiences that I can very easily imagine myself being in. Believing I'm the main character is not a difficult task, if that makes sense? Anyways, yeah, this book is like that. And I loved it.</p>

            <p>my name is lou. i'm a transgender girl from belgium who loves difficult games and money. i have awful memory</p>
            <p>i think writing style is pretty inconsistent, sometimes i try to type with proper punctuation but other times i cbb.</p>
            <p>making a blog always seemed super cool, which is why i decided to make one. hi! i hope no one reads this. casting yourself into the endless sea of the internet is scary.</p>
            <p>my big passions are (loosely ranked in order of importance, but i absolutely love everything mentioned) dog of dracula, homestuck, the lou series, bullet hells, class of 09, ena: dream bbq, panty and stocking, undertale/deltarune. i also dabble in vns and music but my tastes are shitty. i will probably write about all of these, when inspiration strikes me</p>
            <p>ive pretty much covered everything. i am currently working on a monifactory playthrough and a prolonged tetris game session. will post updates. </p>
            <p>you can reach me on discord at loun.europa !</p>

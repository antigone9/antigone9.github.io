                <p>Winter is always a busy time. Finals make you busy. So fucking busy. My God. But today, finally, I am free! And I find myself once again being inspired to write.</p>
                <p>I spent Christmas alone this year. Not that this is a sad, or inherently bad things. I simply didn't feel like celebrating. I am not religious and have always felt Christmas was a bit of a master consumerist stratagem.<p></p>
                <p>It also probably doesn't help that my birthday is in November and that I already got myself some sick Fireball itemage. One day, I'm gonna have to talk about Fireball.</p>
                <p>So, what have I been doing? Studying, mostly. Oh my God. Whatever, we're over that. I've been playing tons of Tetris and MID Human, which is an Infernum challenge in Terraria. No luck for Gregtech. :(</p>
                <p>I don't know how to fit this but it's important to me, so: I believe the best gift is money. At least, if you don't know who you're gifting to. Making gifts based on surface level assumptions is significantly more harmful than simply giving nothing. For example, imagine you gift someone a book. What does that mean about you? Moreover, what does that mean about the person who you're gifting to? Personally, I would gather that the person gifting the book believes the person receiving the book is an illiterate sucker who should read a goddamn book for a change, since gifts are always received as an act of lacking. You are gifted what you do not have, therefore what you are gifted is effectively what you are, since you are everything that you aren't. This does not apply to well thought-out, genuine gifts. If someone were to gift me a FIREBALL MICROSD+DVD set, I would be overjoyed since I enjoy Fireball. There is no subtext here, since it is a genuine act of gifting.</p>
                <p>My coding has also been slowly getting better. I've been modding a game I like and it's been great fun. We'll see if I want to deck this blog out more in the future.
                <p>For the future of this blog, I am planning on introducing new sections, like a book review and a mechanical pencil log. We will see what comes out of that. I also swear the Homestuck chronic will continue.</p>
                <p>I have high hopes.</p>
